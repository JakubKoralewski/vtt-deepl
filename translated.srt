1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,600
Video games are experiencing rapid development.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Their artificial worlds

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,920
are becoming more and more detailed and therefore more

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,520
realistic, the stories they tell more and more complex.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,520
In contrast to films,

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,920
video games adapt individually to the viewers.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,160
Now guess where the Hollywood of video games lies!

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,480
Not in America or Asia, certainly not in Germany,

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,120
but in Poland.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,680
This is also where

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,640
the most eagerly awaited game of the year comes from.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,960
The release of "Cyberpunk 2077" has been

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,440
postponed several times, but now it is imminent.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,240
We present the 57 years of history playing in the future

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,200
and show you previously unpublished graphical material.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,360
weird music

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,280
You are player and storyteller.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,960
What happens when the big corporations become even more powerful

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,960
when they buy up all the small companies?

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
And what happens when the American president

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,920
we have right now is re-elected ten more times?

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Where does the journey go?

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,000
The journey goes to Night City,

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,560
a Moloch on the American West Coast.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
The city leaves you no choice.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,560
Either you burn alive or

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,520
you never existed.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,680
"Cyberpunk 2077" is half film noir, half pessimistic science fiction.

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,080
Gangs spread chaos and terror, just

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,240
like the private militias of huge corporations.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Typical for the genre, the game

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
asks where humanity begins and where it ends.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,480
Body modifications are the order of the day in Night City.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,800
Our game reflects the end time capitalism, where

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,200
the world is controlled by huge corporations.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,600
For example, if we look at the police in our game, the NCPD,

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
the Night City Police Department,

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,160
whose jurisdiction basically ends where that of

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,560
the corporations begins.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
The technical possibilities are almost limitless.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
State and moral structures have almost disappeared.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
Miles Tost helped develop this dystopia.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,680
He worked on it for about four years, together with 500 colleagues.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,320
A mammoth project of the Polish developer studio "CD Projekt Red",

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,880
made famous with the blockbuster game "Witcher 3".

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,760
The game about the sorcerer Geralt von Riva was so successful

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
that it became stylistically the template for a Netflix series,

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,160
the most successful in 2019.

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
When we started working on "Cyberpunk",

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,200
I was also interested in a technological leap.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
The most important thing was the

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
immersion, that I, as a gamer, could dive into the world of "Cyberpunk".

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,360
We worked a lot on creating a high level of game flow.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,080
When I move around the city as a player

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
and meet new characters,

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,240
I have no cuts, no interruptions.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,840
As a player, I'm in the game all the time.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
This leads to

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,240
the fact that the experiences in the story touch me very much.

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,120
The player slips into the role of "V", a mercenary.

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,280
It's about overcoming one last limit: our finiteness.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
"V" is in search of a biochip that

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
promises eternal life.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,720
That much is clear. The rest is up to the players on the inside.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,840
Where did V grow up?

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,240
Which cyber implants will V be equipped with?

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Boundaries also disappear in appearance and gender.

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
V can be male, female or even transgender.

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
Still a provocation for many

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,760
and in catholic Poland a provocative topic.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,760
I think that not only in Poland, but also especially in Poland, this

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,560
has attracted a lot of criticism worldwide.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,160
But as a studio we position ourselves very clearly.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,760
As an individual, I also think it's very good that we do that.

75
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,000
Our studio advertises that we are an environment for

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,640
creativity from all minds and from all walks

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,360
of life and that we have a very open policy.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
The studio positions itself clearly.

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,520
When women in Poland take to the streets against the tightened

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
abortion law, Ciri from "Witcher 3" showed up with red

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
lightning, the symbol of the protests.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,680
A lot of women work at "CD Projekt Red".

83
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,480
For us it is important to really pay attention to all groups.

84
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,640
"CD Projekt Red" also stands for this other Poland,

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,640
beyond the Catholic Church and the Pis party.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,440
The country has become a creative hotspot for gaming.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Poland is the fourth largest exporter of video games,

88
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
ahead of Germany and the USA.

89
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,920
I have been there for 7 years now.

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,320
What I noticed positively right at the

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,320
beginning is that it's probably part of the Polish

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,000
nature not to talk so much and not to have such a big mouth.

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,680
But the game is even bigger.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,480
It has been created, at the latest since the

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,040
pandemic, also in home offices all over the world.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,760
Including old acquaintances:

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Trust me or not, I don't give a shit!

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,520
It's really the smallest of our problems.

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,320
Keanu Reeves has taken on a leading role.

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,640
You're history, asshole!

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,400
The players inside are thrown into this open world.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,560
The possibilities to move around in the

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,320
game are individual and impressive.

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,320
A gloomy, sad, but also exciting playground.

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Unlike in films, we don't have a

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,400
story that is told from A to B in a fixed way to the end.

107
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,560
Rather, the player can make decisions based on a

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,960
variety of options in the game.

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,760
These decisions ensure that the story adapts,

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,760
changes and develops differently.

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,320
What does it mean to be human in this world?

112
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,960
How do the players react? Do they give Royce the money?

113
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,240
Pistol shot It

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,320
can also be pacifist: Here

115
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,920
is the money on it!

116
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
What the players appreciate is that

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
they are confronted with their own morals a little bit.

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
This results in a very personal story, because

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,320
it depends very much on the moral

120
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,920
compass of the player.

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,200
Nothing in the game is clearly black and white.

122
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,960
I was expecting him.

123
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,040
Like a good film noir, "Cyberpunk" knows all the grayscales

124
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,120
and neon lights that are reflected in puddles.

125
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,720
A world in which a happy end is not intended.
